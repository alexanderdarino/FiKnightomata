# Rivas Finite Automaton (RFA) File Format Specification V0.0.0
# By: Alexander Darino
# Used to unambiguously represent both DFAs and (E-)NFAs. Once states and alphabet symbols are defined, they are then referenced by number in the order of their definition.

NUMBER OF STATES
statename_1
statename_2
...
statename_n

# THIS IS A LINE COMMENT; if a line begins with #, ignore it

NUMBER OF ALPHABET SYMBOLS
sym_1
sym_2
...
sym_n
#NOTE: Symbols can be any single-line string, such as "HELLO WORLD!!!"

FOR EACH STATE 1 through N (in order of state #)
	FOR EACH SYMBOL (in order of symbol #, 0 represents epsilon transition)
		COMMA DELIMITED LIST OF STATE #s REPRESENTING TRANSITION STATES OR 0 IF UNDEFINED/ERROR/NONE/ETC (IE. TERMINAL FAILURE)
		SPACE
	NEWLINE
#NOTE: The presence of a comma indicates there is another integer following. For a given input,
# stop reading transition states when you read a transition state that is not followed by a comma

# DFA EXAMPLE:
#INPUTS:0	1	2
#	1	2	3
#	2	3	1
#	3	1	2

# E-NFA EXAMPLE:
#INPUTS:0	1	2
#	0	0	1
#	1 , 2	2, 3	0
#	1,	2 2	3	NOTE: On input 0 transitions go to states 1 and 2 and on input 1 transitions go to state 2. Obviously poorly-formed but a good example

START STATE NUMBER

NUMBER OF ACCEPTING STATES
acceptingstatenumber_0
acceptingstatenumber_1
...
acceptingstatenumber_n-1
